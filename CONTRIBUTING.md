## Creating new releases

This repo uses [Release Please](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/release-please-action) to automatically create releases, based on [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

To create a new release use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) in your commit message. 
On merging new code to the `main` branch this will automatically create a release PR, which you can merge to create the 
new release when you are ready.

Use the following keywords in your commits:

* `fix:` this indicates a bug fix and creates a new patch version (e.g. 1.0.1).
* `feat:` this indicates a new feature and creates a new minor version (e.g. 1.1.0).
* To create a new major version (e.g. 2.0.0) either append an exclamation mark to `fix!:` or `feat!:` or add a footer of `BREAKING CHANGE:` with details of what breaking changes there are.

If the action fails to run you can view the action and select `Re-run all jobs` to re-run it.
