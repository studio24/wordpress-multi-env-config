# Studio 24 WordPress Multi-Environment Config

It is common practise in web development to create multiple environments for a website when testing it, for example 
development, staging and production. It is also a common requirement to need different configuration depending on the 
environment type, for example different database credentials.

This repository supports different configuration for different environments. It is Studio 24's standard config setup for 
WordPress sites.

Credit is due to FocusLabs [EE Master Config](https://github.com/focuslabllc/ee-master-config)
who gave me the inspiration for the organisation of the config files.
